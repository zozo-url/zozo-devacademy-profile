        <h3>HOW MY CULTURE INFLUENCES MY VALUES AND IDENTITY</h3>
        <p>I grew up in Blenheim, a small town in the South Island. Throughout my life we mostly lived on welfare and I witnessed some pretty dark consequences of poverty. As I got older, I ultimately assimilated to middle class, academic culture where I now have access to much more priviledge than I initially knew. I see the importance of justice, humility and the active pursuit of betterment as all linked to these experiences. I want to constantly educate myself and become more virtuous as to best serve my community and make a positive impact in the world. </p>   
        <br>
        <h3>STRENGTHS + LIMITATIONS</h3>
        <p>I’m very driven to learn, I find I have a strong capacity for conceptualizing new knowledge. I believe I will thrive in a creatively-driven work environment, as I think I work well at combining analytical and abstraction skills. Most of the time in group work environments, I find I can strike a positive balance between sharing ideas and listening to others. I feel that I can play a pretty diplomatic role in group scenarios, helping others communicate with eachother and finding a solution that everyone is happy with. </p>
        <p>My biggest limitations to learning are my ability to get distracted, irritated and disillusioned at times. I daydream quite frequently which makes it hard to focus on the gritter parts of a task. I get frustrated with small details; I’d much rather focus on the bigger picture. I can also become quiet and not stand behind my ideas if I feel intimidated by a group dynamic, or become too argumentative/self-righteous if I feel above it. These are both scenarios that I work to avoid, but have occurred when I was younger and less emotionally mature. </p>
        <br>
        <h3>HOW MY STRENGTHS WILL AID MY LEARNING</h3>
        <p>I think my ability to think both analytically and creatively will help me problem-solve through new interactions with coding. My drive to see a task through means that although I may get distracted and irritated temporarily, I tend to stay resilient when I see value in completing said task.</p>
