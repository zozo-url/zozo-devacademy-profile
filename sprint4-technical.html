            <i>Got blocked on a simple problem.</i>
        </p>
        <p>
            I needed to access a value from an object (which is a block of code that has particular properties you 
            define), and the line of code you use to do that includes dots and/or brackets to follow the route of 
            access, kinda like going through the series of folders on your computer to get to the file you want. 
            I couldn’t get my head around when to use dots or brackets and when I tried a few different combinations 
            I couldn’t figure out what I was doing wrong! So I read through the article that was linked in the kata 
            exercise about it, and cross-referenced this with a few other websites. I felt like I understood the 
            concept but the thing still wasn’t working. In the end, I kept trying things and looking at example code, 
            then I realised I had quotation marks around the code I’d put in brackets, which I didn’t need to do. 
            I was very frustrated initially because I thought I was doing what logically made sense based on what I 
            was reading, but still getting confused. I learnt that it’s important to break apart what you’ve written 
            so you can notice small errors.

            <i>Solved a problem in an elegant way</i>
        </p>
        <p>
            I started an exercise by laying out the pseudocode (lines of text that are just step by step descriptions 
            of what you want the code to do). I did this one step at a time, fulfilling each part to pass each smaller 
            test. I was able to complete the whole thing relatively quickly, and when I came across issues I had a clear 
            understanding of what I was trying to do with the code so I could come up with solutions more efficiently. 
            I felt calm and focused during the process and learnt that I was very capable of completing the tests if I 
            kept myself focused.

        <h4>Reflect on how confident you feel using the problem solving techniques and process:</h4>
        <p>
            Having now applied multiple problem solving techniques, I am starting to figure out what works for me and feel 
            confident in my capacity to reach a solution. Because I still need time for certain concepts to sink it, it was 
            hard to initially extract benefit from things such as the rubber ducky method or pseudocode. I found that I couldn’t 
            really reach the solutions through my own thinking alone at this point, and so relied heavily on google for support. 
            I feel that I now know good resources for learning certain things and how to effectively cross reference different 
            types of resources in order to reach understanding. After educating myself further, I could then apply some other methods 
            such as reading error messages and console logging to get myself to a solution.
