    <h1>MY LEARNING PLAN</h1>
    <div class="text">
    <h3>STRENGTHS</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Creative</li>
            <li>Open-minded</li>
            <li>Diplomatic</li>
            <li>Driven</li>
        </ul>   
    <h3>WEAKNESSES</h3>
    <p>Sometimes I get distracted, irritated and/or disillusioned, struggle to endure boring details/things I’m not interested in doing, get frustrated with people with ideas/approaches I don’t agree with.</p>
    <br>
        <h3>HOW I'LL MANAGE MY WORKLOAD</h3>
        <h4>PRODUCTIVITY</h4>
        <p>Being mindful of what external factors make distracted/irritated/disillusioned and structure my schedule accordingly to make the most of my time.</p>
        <p>During foundations, I will prioritise getting up early and having a good morning routine with breakfast, yoga, journal writing, etc. (I will develop exactly what works through trial and error). I will also make sure I have lunch during the day and drink a lot of water. I will plan my weeks and my days out before I get started to keep me focused. I will work to take regular breaks and limit social media use. </p>
        <p>During bootcamp, again I’ll make sure I’m eating well, drinking water and taking regular breaks. Staying mindful when approaching problems and follow the problem-solving process.</p>
        <h4>WORKING WITH OTHER LEARNERS/FACILITATORS</h4>
        <p>Maintain the practice of empathy, really listen to others suggestions and find positive compromises. Ultimately, work to build connections with those around me through humility, so asking/giving help is easy.</p>
        <h4>WORKING WITH INDUSTRY/COMMUNITY</h4>
        <p>Present myself with passion, integrity and humility, and take onboard their perspectives/insights.</p>
        <br>
        <h3>HOW/WHERE I WILL SEEK HELP</h3>
        <p>I will try and work through the problem myself a couple of times with the help of internet searching, then ask other learners personally or through slack, then ask facilitators if I’m still stuck. </p>
        <br>
        <h3>WHAT I EXPECT FROM FACILITATION TEAM</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Humility</li>
            <li>Support</li>
            <li>Active interest</li>
            <li>Meaningful critique</li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        <h3>OTHER COMMITMENTS</h3>
        <p>Work on Friday/Saturday nights, gigs I’m playing/organizing, and other creative side projects.</p>
