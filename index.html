        <p>HELLO MY NAME IS ZOE CLAASEN (YOU CAN CALL ME ZO OR ZOZO IF U WANT BUT IT'S NOT A BIG DEAL) I'M FROM BLENHEIM ORIGINALLY, HAVE BEEN LIVING IN WELLINGTON FOR AROUND FOUR YEARS. OUTSIDE OF CODING, I ALSO MAKE MUSIC, DJ, MAKE GRAPHICS AND SOMETIMES ORGANISE EVENTS. I'M AT DEV ACADEMY BECAUSE I REALLY ENJOY CODING AND BEING CREATIVE THROUGH TECH. I ALSO THINK IT WILL BE A GREAT SKILL TO HAVE IN ORDER TO GET $$$ AND FOR MY OWN SIDE PROJECTS.</p>
