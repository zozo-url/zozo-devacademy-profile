    <h1>EMOTIONAL INTELLIGENCE</h1>
    <div class="text">
<p>Emotional Intelligence is the development of skills in relation to understanding and managing emotions. Understanding emotions can be broken down into smaller skills: ability to recognize emotions in oneself and others (particularly within subtleties and unspoken actions), to comprehend emotional nuances (i.e. complex feelings), to see the context/causes of said emotional responses and the ramifications of these responses. This understanding is perceptual and speculative, and therefore ‘managing emotions’ can be seen as the active application of this understanding.  This involves the ability to regulate ones emotion response to external circumstances as well as the ability to socialise confidently and empathetically. </p>
<p>Emotional Intelligence can be developed through the active creation of neural pathways related to emotional awareness and discipline. As instinctual animals living within complex cooperative society, empathy and emotional regulation allow us to function more effectively as individuals and as a group.</p>
