    <h1>NEUROPLASTICITY AND THE GROWTH MINDSET</h1>
    <div class="text">
<p>Neuroplasticity is the brains ability to change and develop based on the formation/strengthening/weakening of neural pathways. Thoughts and actions set off particular neurons in the brain, and through repetitive thought/action, these become stronger. This can be beneficial, in the case of learning new things and developing better thoughts/habits, but can also work to reinforce negative thoughts/habits and make them harder to break. At the very least, understanding that change is forever possible and that we are not stuck with wherever our brain is at as adults is a freeing experience that gives individuals the agency to selectively create/minimize certain pathways. </p>
<p>This relates to the fixed vs. growth mindset model. A fixed mindset is believing that our abilities are fixed and cannot be improved. This mindset limits the individual as they may not attempt to learn new things if it is not inherently intuitive for them. By contrast, the growth mindset takes into account the truth of neuroplasticity and understands that they have the ability to grow and improve. People who have this mindset will therefore be more open to new ideas and new experiences as they understand that they have the ability to grasp these things, regardless of whether they connect with them immediately.</p>
<p>I personally can relate to the feeling of not being able to do something if I haven’t been able to get it the first time I try it. I also battle with negative thought patterns related to anxiety and depression. As I’ve identified prior, I can become frustrated or disillusioned in the face of problems, and also dissociate in the face of my anxiety/depression. Through understanding neuroplasticity and the growth mindset, I’m able to curb many of my anxiety-related beliefs and work towards the development of more productive/rational thoughts. With my learning specifically, knowledge of these concepts and the active pursuit of them allow me to deal with hurdles better. I’m able to understand that my lack of ability/comprehension is temporary, and that if I continue to work hard and work efficiently, then I’ll eventually get to a point of understanding.</p>
