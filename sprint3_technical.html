            <h4>An analogy to describe the differences between HTML and CSS:</h4>
            <p>HTML is the main bulk ingredients of a meal, like the vegetables and the rice. CSS by comparison, is the choice of spices, sauces and the garnish.
            </p>
            <h4>Explain control flow and loops using an example process from everyday life:</h4>
            <p>Control flow and loops can also be compared to cooking! There is a particular order you follow, and particular decisions you make based on the state of other variables. For example, while onions are less than caramelized, chop vegetables and add time. Then, if onion are caramelized && vegetables are chopped, add vegetables! 
            </p>
            <h4>Describe what the DOM is and an example of how you might interact with it:</h4>
            <p>The DOM stands for Document Object Model. It is a document representation of the code involved in a webpage. HTML elements become objects within the document known as nodes, and JavaScript can access these nodes and manipulate them. Through software such as Google Chromes DevTools, you can also manipulate the code of any websites DOM on your local server.
            </p>
            <h4>Explain the difference between accessing data from arrays and objects:</h4>
            <p>Data within an array is accessed numerically based on where it is positioned.In contrast, object data has a property name (either symbol or string) that is called on specifically with either a dot or brackets.
            </p>  
            <h4>Explain what functions are and why they are useful:</h4>
            <p>Functions are object statements that have inputs (parameters) that affect their outputs. An important feature of functions is that they can be called on later with different input argument values. This is useful because it minimizes the amount of code needed overall, which minimizes potential errors and makes it easier to debug.</p>
