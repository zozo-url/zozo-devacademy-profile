        <h3>What are three new things you have learned about yourself and your ego 
            as a result of the core learning?</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>I’ve learnt that I have the capacity to be mindful and take control 
                of my responses to certain situations</li>
            <li>I’ve learnt that certain ideas I’ve had about myself do not serve me</li>
            <li>lI’ve learn that I am constantly changing and growing</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>What has surprised you the most about the core learning?</h3>
        <p>
            How instantaneous the learning became a part of my overall perspective on 
            life and what a difference it made just to understand concepts like neuroplasticity 
            and emotional intelligence
        </p>
        <h3>What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?</h3>
        <p>
            Defining my values/strengths/limitations was hard because it is strange to try and 
            quantify myself. It was also initially challenging to do the active listening as I 
            struggle with social anxiety and was a bit nervous to meet up with someone I didn’t 
            know very well. However, it was really rewarding to understand the thinking of 
            someone else and it was good for my mental health to push myself out of my comfort 
            zone.
        </p>
        <h3>Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on core 
            learning in a web development bootcamp course?</h3>
        <p>
            Because emotional intelligence and effective learning strategies are skills that will
            serve individuals in the workplace.
        </p>
        <h3>Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time? Should 
            you have just used that time to practicing programming instead? Justify your answer.</h3>
        <p>
                Not at all. My approach to coding/problem solving will always be improved by a 
                healthy state of mind.
